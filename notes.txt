solved the issue of overwriting/updating the user input as the timestamp gets updated by separating and replacing the function
that updates the timeline where the chat gets updated and before scanning for user input

-we need to fix the structure of the files
- fix/update sender time (optional ig)
- the new usernam is not being updated for the other users or the prompt
- if the username is updated it does not show the prompt
